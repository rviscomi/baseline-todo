# ðŸš§ PROPOSAL: baseline-todo

_Annotate your code with reminders to use Baseline features when ready_

The reminders are set as inline code comments, in the context of the relevant parts of the application that should use the Baseline feature.

The format of the comments uses a special syntax to annotate which feature you care about. It's an extension of the TODO comment pattern that developers already frequently use:

- The `TODO` keyword at the start of the comment
- Opening parenthesis `(`
- The keyword `baseline/`
- The ID of the Baseline feature
- Closing parenthesis `)`
- An optional colon `:` followed by a command

For example:

```css
/* TODO(baseline/color-function): Remove legacy rgb color value. */
color: rgb(0, 255, 0);
color: color(display-p3 0 1 0);
```

Use a `TODO` comment to declare your intent to migrate to the Baseline feature when ready. Some developer tools may watch for an individual feature's Baseline availability and proactively notify you when your TODO can be addressed.

Some developer tools may also attempt to alert you if you're using an unguarded feature that isn't Baseline, but the presence of a `TODO` indicates that you understand the risks and so any alerts for it should be silenced.

> [!NOTE]
> End-user developer tooling like PageSpeed Insights or browser DevTools would need visibility into your code comments in order to reliably assess your app's Baseline status. If sourcemaps are available, the tools should assess the comments from the source code. Otherwise, you may need to make changes to your build process to preserve baseline-todo comments.

The optional command at the end of the comment could be used as a reminder to yourself about what migration steps need to be taken. In a future with AI-powered tooling, this command could also be fed to the LLM as an instruction to handle the migration automatically.

## Inline code comments

Annotating exactly where you intend to use feature _in the source code itself_ is the best way to use baseline-todo.

Code is living and breathing, and code gets moved around and deleted all the time. Inline comments are embedded into the code, which means they can evolve along with the thing they're describing. If a feature is no longer needed, for example, the associated comments are usually deleted at the same time as the code itself. This is made much easier by the fact that you're more likely to remove a comment when it's directly adjacent to the code you're already touching.

Inline comments are also valuable considering the long time frames that they might live in the code base. It could be months or (more likely) years from when you first hear about an interesting feature to when it's finally interoperable. You can add an inline comment to indicate your interest in using a feature without actually having to commit to it or figure out any of the implementation details beyond where to put it. When the time comes and the feature's ready, you can search for the relevant comments and be taken to the exact place in the code that you identified earlier, even if the code itself has evolved.

One last benefit of inline comments is the context they provide to LLMs that may be tasked with assisting with the feature migration, when ready. LLMs perform better when they know more about where you want to use the feature and what the existing code already looks like. Source files can be enormous, which poses challenges to LLMs with limited context windows. Even for small files, it might not be immediately obvious where the optimal place to add, remove, or modify code is. Context can be localized to the immediate area around the comment to take away a lot of guesswork and improve performance.

### HTML

An HTML comment to annotate markup that will need to be modernized with Baseline functionality:

```html
<!-- TODO(baseline/popover): Set the `popovertarget` attribute to the ID of the corresponding popover content. -->
<button id="popover-trigger">Toggle the popover</button>


<!-- TODO(baseline/popover): Add the `popover` attribute. -->
<div id="mypopover">Popover content</div>
```

Two comments are used on lines of code that may be far apart in the source HTML to indicate both places that would need to be updated.

Also note that, in this case, there should also be corresponding TODOs in the CSS and JS to clean up other obsolete positioning and event handling.

### CSS

CSS comments to modify and remove styles to use logical properties:

```css
.my-element {
  /* TODO(baseline/logical-properties): Use padding-inline-start instead. */
  padding-left: 20px;
}


/* TODO(baseline/logical-properties): Remove RTL-specific styles. */
html[dir="rtl"] .my-element {
  padding-left: 0;
  padding-right: 20px;
}
```

CSS comment to remove a legacy fallback property, while progressively enhancing for supported browsers:

```css
header {
  /* TODO(baseline/color-function): Remove legacy rgb color value. */
  color: rgb(0, 255, 0);
  color: color(display-p3 0 1 0);
}
```

A CSS comment to indicate that you're knowingly using a feature that is not Baseline:

```css
:root {
  /* TODO(baseline/accent-color): Surprisingly, this is not actually Baseline yet. Remove this comment once it is. */
  accent-color: fuchsia;
}
```

In this case, [`accent-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color) is technically Baseline Limited availability due to a color contrast issue in Safari. But this may be a tolerable risk while getting use out of the feature everywhere else, so this comment can be used to suppress any tooling alerts.

### JavaScript

A JavaScript comment to flag fallback code for an API that is not Baseline:

```js
// TODO(baseline/api.Scheduler.yield) Remove this function.
function yieldToMain() {
  if (globalThis.scheduler?.yield) {
    return scheduler.yield();
  }

  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(resolve, 0);
  });
}

async function example() {
  // TODO(baseline/api.Scheduler.yield) Use scheduler.yield directly without fallbacks.
  await yieldToMain();
}
```

## Possible tooling add-ons

Developers can stay on top of Baseline availability for the features they care about in the tools they already use. This section explores some of those opportunities.

### Feature ID auto-suggestion and validation

IDE plugins can help map Baseline feature names to IDs using an inline search and auto-suggest feature. Invalid feature IDs can also be statically linted in the IDE and flagged as errors.
  
For example typing `TODO(baseline/` could bring up the search field, and entering "lazy loading" or "loading=lazy" would result in the closest match `loading-lazy` being suggested.

If an incorrect variant of that feature ID was used instead, eg `lazy-loading`, the linter could flag it and suggest the correct ID, `loading-lazy`.

Alternatively, if the ID of a readily available feature is used, the linter could flag the entire TODO to avoid shipping unnecessary legacy code.

### Baseline shortlinks

IDE plugins can turn a Baseline TODO comment into a clickable link. For example:

> `/* TODO(baseline/accent-color) */`

could become:

> `/* TODO(`[`baseline/accent-color`](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/features/accent-color/)`) */`

where the feature name links to the corresponding page on the web platform features explorer site.

The linked page would provide more info about the feature, including current Baseline status, browser support, and more links to docs.

### Feature dashboards

See all of the baseline-todo features at a glance in a single dashboard. For each feature, see its:

- Baseline status and availability date
- supported browser versions and release dates
- percent of supported users and page views
- number of code dependencies

This view should give developers a better sense of which features are already or nearly ready to use.

### GitHub action to perform feature ID validation on PRs

Similar to the IDE validation above, a GitHub action can validate all feature IDs added or modified in a PR.

### Integration with Baseline preferences in `package.json`

Enforcement of Baseline "readiness" can be determined by the project-level preferences in the `package.json` config.

For example, a project can specify Baseline Widely available as their preferred threshold. Alerts would only be raised when a feature of interest becomes Widely available.

Theoretically, Baseline preferences can also be set in terms of real-user analytics data. For example, if 98% of users are on browsers that already support a feature, it can be safely used in production. Or readiness can be determined by a combination of real-user data and Widely available status, whichever comes first.

### GitHub action to file an issue when the feature is ready

If a feature is determined to be ready for adoption based on its Baseline availability status and project preferences, a GitHub action can proactively file an issue to raise awareness directly to the developers. The issue can include links to the relevant docs on MDN to help with the migration.

### GitHub action to open a PR with AI-assisted changes migrating to the feature

With AI assistance, it might also be possible for the GitHub action to resolve the feature migration itself.

GitHub already has a feature called [Copilot Autofix](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/responsible-use-autofix-code-scanning) for addressing security vulnerabilities, based on a similar principle. The issues are discovered during [code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning) sweeps, which could potentially be expanded to also consider Baseline availability.

These AI-assisted PRs could also be triggered manually, for example as a dry-run to verify that the migration would be completed smoothly when ready.

The TODO design lends itself nicely to AI assistance in a few ways:

1. The comments are added directly to the relevant parts of the code, so irrelevant code can be ignored to maximize the context window size.
2. TODOs for a feature can be added across HTML, CSS, and/or JS as needed, which helps to ensure that the assistant fully migrates all of the affected code.
3. Descriptive comments give the LLM clearer direction on how to complete each task.
4. The feature IDs can be mapped to additional information that provides helpful context, like sample code before and after the migration.
5. Developers manually add the TODOs themselves, so they should be more likely to accept the assistance, unlike auto-generated PRs that are unsolicited.

> [!NOTE]
> Here's a proof of concept demo of the way an LLM would currently handle the `scheduler.yield()` migration task from the JavaScript example above:
>
> <img width="994" alt="Gemini 2.0 Flash resolving the TODOs" src="img/migrate-yield.png" />
>
> Even with such a basic prompt, Gemini 2.0 Flash was able to correctly address both TODOs by removing the `yieldToMain` function and replacing its function call with the direct usage of `scheduler.yield()` instead.

### Advanced feature validation

To improve the chances that features are migrated smoothly and successfully, part of the validation step may be to check whether all of the necessary code dependencies have been properly annotated with TODOs. For example, `TODO(baseline/popover)` doesn't make sense in the markup alone, because legacy implementations require additional CSS and JS. Developers can be warned about missing dependencies from IDE plugins or GitHub actions.

The validator could use AI to reason about what those must-have dependencies should be, or they can be manually added as a structured data field in the web features API for high priority features.

## Other potential benefits

Besides tooling add-ons, there are some additional benefits that this system might provide.

### Feature analytics

Installations of the `baseline-todo` package (both locally and in GitHub actions) could potentially beacon usage statistics back to an analytics endpoint. That could provide a source of insights into things like the number of applications that are gated on a particular feature becoming available in Baseline, the number of times it successfully saved a developer from unnecessarily shipping legacy code, or the number of issues or PRs filed. This feature should be developed with privacy top of mind.

Another way to get analytics about features in the wild is to query public datasets for the `TODO(baseline...)` syntax. The GitHub Search API could be a window into which features are used, but this data would only be available for publicly discoverable repositories. The HTTP Archive dataset is another way to get real-world data, but it wouldn't provide the sourcemapped files, and it would only be available on home and secondary pages.

One interesting angle to this data is to potentially look at how quickly sites fully adopt features after they become Baseline-ready, and if sites using AI-assisted migration PRs are quicker to adopt them.
